Firebase Trains is an app that allows users to create and update fictional trains. 
The app then creates an arrival board that keeps track of the train schedules. 
The Train Scheduler Application begins with a form that requests the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. 
Once entered, the train is stored in Firebase and placed in the current train schedule.
The frequency, arrival time, and minutes away is determined by MomentJS. 

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Firebase, MomentJS, jQuery
